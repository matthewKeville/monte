This is an implementation of n-cup monte.
The goal is to track the ball as the cups move around.
There exists customization options in monte.js such as
editing the allowed transformation speeds and mixups.
The intent is to eventually make a menu to access this 
customization.

The project relies on THREE.js and math.js
